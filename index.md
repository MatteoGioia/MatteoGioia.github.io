# About me

Hello there! My name is Matteo and I'm a PhD student in Data Science

I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of L'Aquila in 2021, and my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Sapienza University in 2023. I am currently working as a PhD student under the supervision of professor Fabio Galasso @ [PINLab](https://www.pinlab.org/).


# Publications

## LEGO (2025)

<!-- add a random robotics related image -->
![Lego Teaser](https://lego-grasp.github.io/static/figures/teaser_figure.png)

LEGO trains robots on simple "toy" objects (spheres, cuboids, cylinders, rings) to achieve 67% grasping success on real YCB objects through object-centric visual representations and zero-shot generalization.

*Work done during internship @ItalAI, with Panasonic R&D and the BAIR Lab*

## MonSTeR (ICCV 2025)
