Hello there! My name is Matteo and I'm a PhD student in Data Science.

I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of L'Aquila in 2021, and my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Sapienza University in 2023. I am currently working as a PhD student under the supervision of professor Fabio Galasso @ [PINLab](https://www.pinlab.org/).

My research interests include computer vision, robotics, and multimodal learning.
